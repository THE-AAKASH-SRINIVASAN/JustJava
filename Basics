//Scanner is an important class whose instances are useful for breaking down 
formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.
As an example the below program reads an int data type, adds 100 to it and prints the new value as the output.//



import java.util.Scanner;

public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(x + 100);
    }
} 

//
The line import java.util.Scanner; denotes the package to find Scanner class. We will learn about packages in later chapters.
Here the instance of the Scanner is created using the standard input (which is the console).

To accept a double we use nextDouble() method.
To accept a char we do not have nextChar but use the next() method and retrieve the first character as shown below.
 char c = sc.next().charAt(0);
//







//
Fill in the missing lines of code so that the program accepts two int data type values and prints their sum as the output.
//



public static Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
         int x=sc.nextInt();
         int y=sc.nextInt();
         System.out.println(x+y);
    }
}



//
Fill in the missing lines of code so that the program accepts the values for two double variables, 
price1 and price2 and prints their sum as the output.
//



import java.util.Scanner;

public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        //Your code below
        double price1=sc.nextDouble();
        double price2=sc.nextDouble();
        System.out.println(price1+price2);
    }


}
